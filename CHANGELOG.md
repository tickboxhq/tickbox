# Changelog

Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.15] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- `@tickboxhq/banner-default`: built-in translations for **8 locales** — `en`, `de`, `fr`, `es`, `it`, `nl`, `pt`, `pl`. Pass `locale="de"` (or any BCP-47 tag like `'fr-CH'`) on `<ConsentBannerDefault>` and `<ConsentNoticeDefault>`. Pass `locale="auto"` to read `navigator.language` at render time. Locale selection layers under the existing `copy` prop so single-string overrides still work on top of any language. New exports from both sub-entries: `locales`, `resolveLocalePack`, `LocalePack`. 14 new tests.
- Locale resolution falls back from full BCP-47 tag (`pt-BR`) to language prefix (`pt`), then to English. Unknown locales return English without throwing — translation gaps degrade gracefully.

### Fixed
- Banner stretched edge-to-edge on wide screens. Added `max-width: 1100px` plus `margin-inline: auto` so the banner stays centred and readable on ultrawide displays.
- Privacy policy link sat on a different baseline from the action buttons. Added `align-items: center` to `.tb-banner-actions`.

## [0.0.13] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- New package: `@tickboxhq/banner-default` — drop-in styled `<ConsentBannerDefault>` and `<ConsentNoticeDefault>` components for sites that don't want to design their own consent UI. GitHub-ish look (system font, 6px corners, subtle border + soft shadow), light/dark via `prefers-color-scheme`, themeable through CSS custom properties. Two sub-entries: `@tickboxhq/banner-default/react` and `@tickboxhq/banner-default/vue`. Customise modal with per-category toggles, focus trap and Escape-to-close.
- New `ConsentSlotApi` type exported from `@tickboxhq/vue` — describes the snapshot of plain values passed to `<ConsentBanner>` and `<ConsentNotice>` slot scopes (distinct from `ConsentApi`, which is the reactive shape returned by `useConsent()`).
- 15 tests covering banner render, modal toggle, copy overrides, the consent-banner-priority rule, and a regression test for the Vue customise click.

### Fixed
- **Equal-prominence design for Accept All / Reject All.** Previous v0.0.12 release styled Accept All as a primary button (dark grey) and Reject All as secondary (white with border), which violates UK ICO and EU EDPB guidance treating unequal visual weight on consent buttons as a dark pattern. Both buttons now use the new `.tb-btn-equal` class with identical styling. Customise is rendered as a ghost button to differentiate it as a different *kind* of action. README documents the rule and how to brand-style without breaking it.
- Vue `<ConsentBannerDefault>` modal didn't open when Customise was clicked. The `showModal` ref lived in the outer component's setup, but the slot-only render boundary didn't track it. Fixed by extracting an inner `BannerInner` component that owns the state in the same scope as the render.
- Vue `<ConsentBanner>` slot now exposes `noticeOpen` and `dismissNotice` for parity with `<ConsentNotice>` (was missing despite being in the type).
- Vue banner-default no longer accesses `.value` on slot api fields — the `<ConsentBanner>` and `<ConsentNotice>` slots pass unwrapped snapshots, not refs. The old code happened to type-check via the misnamed `ConsentApi` type but would have crashed at runtime had a user ever opened the customise modal.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- First-class support for `notice`-mode UI. New `ConsentState.noticeOpen` flag is set on first visit when a site has only `notice`-mode categories (e.g. UK DUAA-exempt analytics like Plausible / GoatCounter). The consent banner takes priority when both modes are present, so the two flags are mutually exclusive.
- New `dismissNotice()` method on `ConsentStore` — closes the notice without persisting a decision.
- New components: `<ConsentNotice>` in `@tickboxhq/react` and `@tickboxhq/vue`. Same headless render-prop pattern as `<ConsentBanner>`, but gates on `noticeOpen` instead of `isOpen`.
- `@tickboxhq/nuxt` auto-registers `<ConsentNotice>` alongside `<ConsentBanner>`.
- `useConsent()` returns `noticeOpen` and `dismissNotice` (React + Vue).
- 9 new tests in `@tickboxhq/core` covering notice-mode behaviour: first-visit notice, banner-over-notice priority, save closing both, return-visit suppression, policy-version refresh reopening notice, dismiss-without-persist, reset reopening the right flag.

### Changed
- `reset()` now reopens whichever flag applies (banner if there's a consent-mode category, otherwise notice). Previously it always reopened the banner even on notice-only sites.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `@tickboxhq/nuxt`: probe `.ts` / `.mts` / `.mjs` / `.js` / `.cjs` when resolving the user's `consent.config` path, so the Nitro `/ai.txt` route handler can import a TypeScript config at runtime. Vite handles extension resolution at build time but Nitro's runtime ESM loader is strict — this only surfaced when `/ai.txt` was hit in dev with a real `.ts` config.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- `@tickboxhq/nuxt`: register a Nitro-specific alias `#tickbox-config` for the `/ai.txt` server route. Nuxt's impound plugin blocks `#build/*` aliases in server runtime, so the previous build threw `RollupError: Vue app aliases are not allowed in server runtime`. The Vue plugin still uses `#build/tickbox-config` (works fine in client context); the server route uses the new alias. One file on disk, two aliases.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- New package: `@tickboxhq/cli`. Two commands:
  - `tickbox scan <url>` — fetches a page and lists tracking vendors detected in the HTML response. ~50 vendor patterns covered (GA, GTM, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, Bing UET, Plausible, Fathom, GoatCounter, Hotjar, FullStory, Microsoft Clarity, Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Heap, HubSpot, Klaviyo, Iterable, Braze, Intercom, Drift, Crisp, etc.). Maps each to a Tickbox category and reports its mode under UK_DUAA.
  - `tickbox validate [path]` — loads a compiled `.js` / `.mjs` consent config and reports issues (missing `policy.version`, undeclared categories referenced from `consentMode`, required categories with `default: false`, unknown gtag keys).
- 10 new tests for vendor pattern matching.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `ConsentConfig.consentMode` — override which Tickbox categories drive which Google Consent Mode v2 keys. Useful when your project uses category names other than the defaults (`marketing`, `analytics`, `functional`, `preferences`). Setting a key to `null` removes it from the `gtag('consent','update', ...)` call entirely.
- New exports from `@tickboxhq/core`: `ConsentModeMapping`, `ConsentModeRule`, `GtagConsentKey`, `ApplyOptions`.
- 7 new tests for the configurable mapping.
- React, Vue and Nuxt providers thread `config.consentMode` through to `applyConsent` automatically.

### Changed
- Bumped core bundle budget from 15 KB to 18 KB to give headroom (current core size ~15.1 KB after the mapping logic).

## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- AI training opt-out generators in `@tickboxhq/core`:
  - `generateAiTxt(config, options)` — Spawning.ai-format `/ai.txt` content. Disallow by default, Allow on explicit opt-in.
  - `generateAiBotRobotsRules(config)` — `robots.txt` fragment with User-agent + Disallow rules for each AI training crawler.
- `@tickboxhq/nuxt` auto-registers a Nitro route at `/ai.txt`. Disable with `tickbox: { aiTxt: false }`.
- Three new example scenarios:
  - `examples/vanilla/ai-training-optout/` — build-time generator script.
  - `examples/nextjs/ai-training-optout/` — App Router route handler at `app/ai.txt/route.ts`.
  - `examples/nuxt/ai-training-optout/` — auto-registered via the module.
- 14 new tests for the generators.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Full test coverage for `apply.ts` (16 cases): script activation, Google Consent Mode v2 mapping, `tickbox:consent-changed` event dispatch. Adds `happy-dom` as a core devDependency.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, build, typecheck, test, bundle-size check on every PR and push to main.
- GitHub Actions release workflow: triggered by `v*` tag pushes. Builds, verifies, publishes all packages to npm with `--provenance` attestations, creates a GitHub release with auto-generated notes.
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` — lockstep version bump + tag creation.
- `scripts/check-bundle-sizes.sh` — portable bash, runs locally and in CI.

### Changed
- CI orders `pnpm build` before `pnpm typecheck` so workspace symlinks have their `dist/` d.ts files in place when `tsc` resolves them.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-05-06 [withdrawn]

Tagged but never published — CI failed before the publish step due to a `dist/` resolution issue in workspace dependencies. Fixed in 0.0.4.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-05-06 [withdrawn]

Tagged but never published — `bump-version.sh` produced multi-line `files` arrays in `package.json`, which Biome flagged. Fixed by piping `pnpm lint:fix` into the bump script. Released as 0.0.4.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

First public release. Five packages:

- `@tickboxhq/core` — types, jurisdictions, store, side-effects.
- `@tickboxhq/react` — `<ConsentProvider>`, `useConsent`, headless `<ConsentBanner>`.
- `@tickboxhq/vue` — `<ConsentProvider>`, `useConsent`, headless `<ConsentBanner>`.
- `@tickboxhq/nuxt` — Nuxt module that auto-imports `useConsent`, auto-registers `<ConsentBanner>`, reads the consent cookie on the server via `useRequestHeaders`.

Key features:

- Three-mode consent model: `consent`, `notice`, `always`.
- Built-in `UK_DUAA` jurisdiction preset implementing the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 statistical-purposes exemption — privacy-friendly analytics resolve to `notice` mode (no banner, just an opt-out).
- Built-in `EU_GDPR` jurisdiction preset (conservative — everything resolves to `consent`).
- Vendor classification catalogue: ~110 known vendors across advertising, session replay, CDP, marketing automation, chat widgets, AI training crawlers, and privacy-friendly analytics.
- Cookie storage with versioned schema (SameSite=Lax, Secure on HTTPS).
- Script tag gating via `<script type="text/plain" data-tb-category="X">`.
- Google Consent Mode v2 integration on every consent change.
- `tickbox:consent-changed` DOM event for custom integrations.
- SSR cookie reading in the Nuxt module.
